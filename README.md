# Factorio

Several blueprints with their description when and why to use it best.

Hint: I normally omit to use small power poles, because I start maps normally without any trees.

## Jumpstarter Base (red, green and blue science)

It's focused on producing 1 red, 1 green and 0.5 blue science per second.
